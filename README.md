## Requirements

- `pacman-contrib` for pacman

## Important

- This program uses the openweathermap API for fetching the weather. You must have an API key from openweathermap for it to work.
- Update checking and package counting will take a long time, and slow down the program by quite a bit. This cannot be avoided because of the fact that these checks require external system commands. Only use these options if you don't mind losing a second or two of time every time you run the program.
- The config format has recently **changed from JSON to TOML.** Make sure you're using the TOML file properly from now on.

## How to use

- Grab the latest release binary and config files from the releases page
- Copy `example_config.toml` to `~/.config/draconis/config.toml`
- Change the config to your liking
- Add the program to your shell's startup
